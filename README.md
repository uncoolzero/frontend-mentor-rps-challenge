## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling

### What I learned

Working from mobile-first! Thanks to Tailwind this was extremely easy, I went from the mobile UI to the desktop version in a few minutes only using CSS. Very cool! I'm also quite happy with how reusable the buttons are, adding the optional game mode would be quite simple in that regard.

### Continued development

My understanding of CSS still isn't perfect, sometimes it can take a while to get going for no real reason. Also, I plan to continue working hard on reusable components and Typescript, they are very powerful tools and made developing this a lot easier.
